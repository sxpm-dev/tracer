# Performance

Wrapped functions call through directly outside a trace scope. When a scope is
active, each call or marker appends event data to the current trace heap.

Use capture options only when needed:

- `captureTiming` calls the clock around each function.
- `captureStack` allocates stack state.
- `captureArgs`, `captureResult`, and `captureError` should redact sensitive
  data.

Run the local benchmark:

```bash
yarn bench:tracer
```
