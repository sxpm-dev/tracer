# Caveats

- Cross-`await` recovery depends on named async frames in `Error.stack`.
- Detached promises, timers, and event listeners need explicit handling.
- The context value is not reactive and does not trigger renders.
- This package is not a dependency injection container.

Use it for stable operation metadata, not arbitrary mutable application state.
